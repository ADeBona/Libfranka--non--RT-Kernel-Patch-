# Libfranka (non) RT Kernel Patch 
 This repository provides instructions to manually apply a patch to the libfranka library, enabling it to run on non-realtime (Non-RT) kernels. The modifications allow users to bypass the strict requirement for a realtime kernel, which is beneficial for systems that cannot use RT kernels due to hardware or software constraints.
